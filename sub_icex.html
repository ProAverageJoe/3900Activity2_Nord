                  <p style="text-align:center">This is a photo of me standing polar bear watch during a submarine operation called ICEX where my sub was up in the North Pole!
                    This was in 2016, and the average temperature was -60Â°F when we were surfaced in the ice.
                    Below is a photo of what my submarine looked like when we surfaced through the ice. 
                    A submarine can only surface through the ice if it's less than 6ft thick.</p>
