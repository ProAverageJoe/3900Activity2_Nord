            Hello, I'm Joshua Nord, and I'm a senior at UNO in the BMS degree program with a focus on information technology.
            I served in the United States Navy in the submarine force for nine and a half years, where I served as a Sonar Technician in San Diego, CA, and as an instructor
            in Groton, CT. I have always been interested in technology and wanted my future career to be working with tech. I have very little exposure to coding outside of the 
            classes I have taken here at UNO. I have used HTML, CSS, Python, and SQL in a very basic sense for other classes, but I have kept those notes
            and I'm using them for this assignment.
            </p>

            In my free time, I enjoy playing video games with friends, going to the gym, and playing golf! I haven't played golf in a couple of years due to shoulder injuries sustained 
            while I was in the service. Here is a picture of one of the last times I enjoyed hitting the clubs!
